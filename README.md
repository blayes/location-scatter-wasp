* Organization
  - There are three directories, two for the simulations (logistic and negbin) and the third for the real data analysis (mult_ml). 
  - Each directory has two sub directories: code and qsub.
  - Directory 'code' has files of all the code (Stan and R source code) that were used in the experiments. 
  - Directory 'qsub' has SGE files (.q) that were used to submit jobs on a SGE cluster. 

* Brief Description of files
  - 'simulate_data.R' contains the code to simulate/partition the data.
  - 'analyze_result.R' contains the code for analyzing the results of MCMC, Mposterior, and competing methods and making plots/tables.
  - 'submit.R' contains the  code for the R code for submitting a job on the cluster. The files in 'qsub' directory use this file for running simulations.
